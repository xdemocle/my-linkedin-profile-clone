## Implementation Details

### Translation Files

All translations are stored in:

```txt
src/messages/
├── en.json  ✅ English (complete)
├── it.json  ✅ Italian (complete)
├── fr.json  ✅ French (complete)
├── es.json  ✅ Spanish (complete)
└── ar.json  ✅ Arabic (complete)
```

### Key Structure

```json
{
  "Common": { ... },
  "ProfileData": {
    "personal": { ... },
    "experience": {
      "exp1": { ... },
      "exp2": { ... },
      ...
    },
    "projects": { ... },
    "skills": { ... },
    "education": { ... },
    "certifications": { ... },
    "achievements": { ... }
  },
  "SampleData": { ... }
}
```

### Updated Hook

`src/hooks/useProfileData.ts` now:

- Reads from translation files using `useTranslations()`
- Dynamically builds profile data based on current locale
- Maintains static data (logos, links, tags) from `profile-data.ts`
- Uses `useMemo` for performance optimization

## How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

### 2. Test Language Switching

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Use the language selector (usually in the header/navigation)
3. Switch between languages: EN → IT → FR → ES → AR
4. Verify all content changes appropriately

### 3. What to Verify

#### Profile Header

- Name stays "Rocco Russo" (proper name)
- Title, headline, and location translate

#### About Section

- Full bio text translates
- Maintains formatting and structure

#### Experience Section

- All 9 work experiences translate
- Company names stay the same
- Positions, descriptions, and highlights translate

#### Projects Section

#### Skills Section

#### Education & Certifications

#### Achievements

### 4. RTL Testing (Arabic)

When switching to Arabic:

- Layout should flip to right-to-left

- UI components should mirror appropriately

## Translation Quality

### Professional Translations

All translations maintain:

- ✅ Technical accuracy
- ✅ Professional tone
- ✅ Cultural appropriateness
- ✅ Consistent terminology
- ✅ Proper grammar and syntax

### Special Considerations

#### Technical Terms

Terms like "React", "TypeScript", "Web3", "DeFi" remain in English across all languages as they are industry-standard technical terms.

#### Proper Names

- "Rocco Russo" stays the same
- Company names (Google, Apple, etc.) stay the same
- Product names stay the same

#### Dates

Date formats may need adjustment per locale (future enhancement).
