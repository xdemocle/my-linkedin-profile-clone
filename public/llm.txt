# Rocco Russo LinkedIn Profile Clone - LLM Context

## Last Updated: January 2, 2026

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of a LinkedIn profile for Rocco Russo, a Frontend Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience. The application showcases personal information, work experience, skills, projects, education, certifications, and achievements. It has been refactored to use the JSON Resume schema for data management with multi-language support.

## Key Features

- Multi-language support with separate JSON Resume files for English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Arabic.
- Dynamic loading of resume data based on user locale using the useJSONResumeAdapter hook.
- UI enhancements including an accordion layout for the skills section.
- Comprehensive documentation updated to reflect the JSON Resume migration and multi-language approach.

## Technical Stack

- React with TypeScript for frontend development.
- Tailwind CSS for styling, following v4 guidelines.
- shadcn/ui components for UI elements like accordions and progress bars.
- Bun as the package manager.
- No SSR, but SSG is implemented.

## Data Structure

- JSON Resume schema as the central data format, with language-specific files in src/data/ (resume-en.json, resume-it.json, etc.).
- Adapter hook (useJSONResumeAdapter.ts) maps JSON Resume data to the existing ProfileData structure for backward compatibility.
- Skills data enriched with levels from skills.json.

## Recent Updates

- Completed refactoring to JSON Resume schema with full data across all languages.
- Updated skills section to use accordion UI for better organization and user experience.

## Current Status

- All tasks related to data refactoring, multi-language support, and UI updates are completed.
- The project is fully functional and ready for further enhancements or deployment.

## For AI Assistance

- This file serves as a context guide for language model interactions.
- Any code changes or updates should adhere to the user rules (e.g., Tailwind CSS for styling, shadcn/ui components, etc.).
- If tasked with modifications, ensure compatibility with the existing structure and maintain the multi-language setup.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight)
- **Build**: Vite, Bun (package manager)
- **i18n**: use-intl
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages with Edge Functions
- **Prerendering**: vite-prerender-plugin

## Supported Languages

- English (en) - Default locale (no prefix in URL)
- Italian (it)
- French (fr)
- Spanish (es)
- Arabic (ar) - RTL support enabled

## Routing Architecture

### URL Structure

```
/                    -> English profile page (default)
/it/, /fr/, /es/, /ar/ -> Localized profile pages
/experience          -> English experience page
/it/experience       -> Italian experience page
/projects            -> English projects page
/it/projects         -> Italian projects page
```

### Routing Rules

1. Default language (English) has no prefix
2. `/en/*` redirects to `/*` (removes default locale prefix)
3. Other languages require `/{locale}/` prefix
4. All routes are prerendered during build

## Data Architecture

### Data Hooks Pattern

All data is accessed through custom hooks located in `src/hooks/`:
- `useProfileData()` - Personal and profile information
- `useEducationData()` - Education history and certifications
- `useCompaniesData()` - Company information
- `useAchievementsData()` - Professional achievements
- `useSkillsData()` - Skills with endorsement data
- `useLocale()` - Current locale and messages

**Purpose**: This abstraction layer prepares for future headless CMS integration. To connect a CMS, only the hooks need modification—UI components remain unchanged.

## Key Directories

### `/src/components/`

- `profile/` - Profile-specific components (Header, About, Experience, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer, PageLayout)
- `ui/` - shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Avatar, etc.)
- `feed/` - Feed-related components
- `messaging/` - Messaging components

### `/src/data/`

Static data files (will be replaced by CMS API in future):

- `profile-data.ts` - Main profile information
- `education.ts` - Education and certifications
- `achievements.ts` - Professional achievements

### `/src/hooks/`

Custom React hooks for data access and utilities

### `/src/lib/`

- `i18n.ts` - Internationalization utilities
- `utils.ts` - Common utility functions

### `/src/pages/`

Page components for different routes

### `/src/messages/`

i18n translation files (en.json, it.json, fr.json, es.json, ar.json)

## Styling Guidelines

### TailwindCSS v4 Rules

- **NEVER** use inline styles or `style` attribute
- Always use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Follow latest v4 guidelines
- Use CSS variables for theming

### Theme System

- Light/Dark mode support via `ThemeProvider`
- System preference detection
- Manual toggle available
- CSS variables: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, etc.

## Internationalization

### Translation Keys

All text uses translation keys via `useTranslations()` from `use-intl`:

```tsx
const t = useTranslations('ComponentName');
<h1>{t('title')}</h1>
```

### Adding New Languages

1. Create message file in `src/messages/{locale}.json`
2. Add locale to `LOCALES` in `src/constants/i18n.ts`
3. Update `LOCALE_CONFIGS` with direction and name
4. Rebuild to generate prerendered pages

## Build Process

### Static Generation

1. Vite builds the application
2. vite-prerender-plugin generates HTML for all routes
3. Each language gets its own directory with `index.html`
4. Assets are copied to `dist/client/assets/`
5. Cloudflare configuration files are copied

### Cloudflare Pages Files

- `_redirects` - URL redirect rules
- `_headers` - HTTP header configuration
- `_routes.json` - Cloudflare Pages routing config
- `_worker.js` - Edge function for custom routing logic

## Testing

### Test Structure

Located in `src/__tests__/`:

- Component tests
- Hook tests
- Library utility tests

### Running Tests

```bash
bun run test          # Run all tests
bun run test:ui       # Run with UI
bun run test:run      # Run specific test file
```

## Development Commands

```bash
bun install           # Install dependencies
bun run dev           # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
bun run build         # Build for production
bun run preview       # Preview production build (http://localhost:8788)
bun run test          # Run tests
bun run lint          # Lint code
```

## Component Guidelines

### ProfileHeader

- Shows user avatar, name, title, location
- Displays follower/connection counts
- Contains action buttons (Open to Work, Resources, Share)

### ProfileMainContent

- Main container for profile sections
- Includes About, Experience, Education, Skills, etc.
- Must always contain ProfileHeader (per user preferences)

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Connected to GitHub repository
2. Auto-deploys on push to main branch
3. Build command: `bun run build`
4. Output directory: `dist/client`
5. Edge functions handle language routing

### Edge Routing

The `_worker.js` file handles:

- Language-specific index.html serving
- Redirect logic for `/en/*` paths
- Content-Language header injection
- Fallback to default language

## Future Enhancements

### Headless CMS Integration (Planned)

When integrating a CMS:

1. Update data hooks in `src/hooks/`
2. Add CMS API client
3. Fetch data based on locale
4. Maintain same TypeScript interfaces

### Performance

- Code splitting (currently warns about chunk size)
- Image optimization
- Font optimization
- Service Worker for PWA

## Important Notes

1. **No SSR**: Project uses SSG (Static Site Generation), not SSR
2. **No inline styles**: Always use TailwindCSS classes
3. **Bun package manager**: Use `bun` instead of npm/yarn
4. **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration
5. **Component library**: Use shadcn/ui components, don't reinvent
