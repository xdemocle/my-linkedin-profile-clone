## 🧠 Technical Design

### Multi-language Architecture

The application implements a sophisticated i18n system with:

- URL-based locale detection.
- Default locale (English) without prefix (`/experience`).
- Localized routes using prefixes (`/fr/experience`).
- Automatic redirects for legacy paths.
- RTL support for Arabic.

### Routes & Pages

```text
/ (en)           - Profile page in English
/it/, /fr/, etc. - Localized profile pages
/experience      - Experience page in English
/*/experience    - Localized experience pages
/projects        - Projects page in English
/*/projects      - Localized projects pages
```

### Components

The application follows a modular component architecture:

- `<ThemeProvider>` — Manages light/dark mode.
- `<LocaleProvider>` — Handles internationalization.
- `<Router>` — Smart routing with locale detection.
- `<ProfileLayout>` & `<PageLayout>` — Layout primitives for all sections.

---

## 📝 Testing Strategy

The test suite validates the critical aspects of the experience:

- **URL generation & parsing** — Core routing logic.
- **Locale detection** — Determines initial app state.
- **Route matching** — Ensures correct page rendering.
- **Language switching** — Confirms seamless UX for all locales.
